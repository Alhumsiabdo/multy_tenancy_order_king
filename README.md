## What is SaaS?

Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is also known as on-demand software, web-based software, or web-hosted software. (From wikipedia).

In the case Orderking, SaaS means that you have a management software for businesses of different types, such as restaurants or merchants, through which they can manage aspects of their business that include:

-   Order management
-   Billing and transaction management
-   User management
-   Analytics for businesses

## Does a SaaS-Web App require the multi-database approach?

A SaaS web app does not require a multi-database approach. We can host the data of different merchants/users in one database using different methods. Both approaches, single database versus a multi-database have their own advantages and disadvantages:

-   Cost efficiency:
    -   Single database: Cheaper, not only in terms of monetary cost, but also in terms of maintenance.
    -   Multi database: Expensive also in terms of maintenance.
-   Simpler data management:
    -   Single database: managing a single database is easier than managing multiple. For example, in Laravel, setting up access for a single database is easier than setting up access for many.
    -   Multi database: More difficult. For example, in Laravel, we need to setup dynamic database creation which can be difficult to implement and deploy.
-   Data sharing:

    -   Single database: what if we needed to share data between the different tenants? A single database approach makes that easier.
    -   Multi database: Sharing data between tenants would require extra code to define who can access who.

-   Data isolation:
    -   Single database: because all data is one database, if our implementation is not correct, we can be at risk of a merchant accessing the data of another merchant.
    -   Multi database: Completely isolated by design.
-   Performance:

    -   Single database: As request number grows, our single database will be queried more. This will lead to longer query times. However, we can solve this problem by using a database replication approach.
    -   Multi database: better performance as each database can be on its own server.

-   Customization and preferences:
    -   Single database: if we have complex customizations for each tenant, then we might end up with a very complex table structure that is difficult to understand and maintain.
    -   Multi database: much simpler structure because of isolation.

## What is multi-tenancy?

Multi-tenancy is a software architecture concept where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants. This is a common architecture for SaaS apps such as OrderKingâ€™s app because we need to serve the same software to multiple restaurants and keep their data isolated and separate. There are two approaches to multi-tenancy, single database and multi database and we explain the advantages and disadvantages of both above.

## Which multi tenancy approach would you use for our project? (single or multi-database?

For our project, we will use a single database approach for the following reasons:

-   A single database setup is good enough in this case, assuming that we do not have many merchants.
-   If our number of merchants increases, we can use a solution such as database replication to handle the extra load.
-   This task has a limited time and spending too much time on setting up a multi database approach will disable me from concentrating on other aspects of the task.

## Implementation details

-   How I achieved multi-tenancy:
    I used the relational approach where I created a merchant_id to indicate to which merchant a user belongs.
-   Superadmin, merchant, and user separation: I achieved this separation by creating different folders in the resources folder using inertiajs.
